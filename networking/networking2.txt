#question# 5
5. An organization has a class C network address of 201.32.64.0. It uses a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248. Which of the following is NOT a valid broadcast address for any subnetworks?
a) 201.32.64.135
b) 201.32.64.240
c) 201.32.64.207
d) 201.32.64.231

#answer
the correct answer is (b)
#explanation
network address=201.32.64.0
subnet mask=255.255.255.248
network prefix=29
#valid ip address ranges
Network address: 201.32.64.0
First usable IP address: 201.32.64.1
Last usable IP address: 201.32.64.6
Broadcast address: 201.32.64.7
the last three bits of the Host address are not 1 therefore itâ€™s not a valid broadcast address.

#question# 4
An organization is assigned a class C network address of 201.35.2.0. It uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192 to divide this into sub-networks. Which of the following is/are valid host IP addresses?
A) 201.35.2.129
B) 201.35.2.191
C) 201.35.2.255
Both (A) and (C)

#answer
the correct answer is ( A )
#explanation
option a is not a broadcast so it can be assigned ip


#question#3
An organization is assigned a class C network address of 201.35.2.0. It uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192. Using this netmask
a) How many subnets can be created. What are the address of the assigned subnetworks?
b) In each subnet, how many IPs each subnet will have
#answer
subnet mask :26
host bits: 32-26=6
no of subnet: 2^6= 64 subnet
useable ip address= 2^(6)-2
                  = 64-2
                  =62 ips
                  
        
#question#2
Consider the 128.100.112.0/21 block of IP addresses. This block of addresses must be divided into four subnetworks that have each at least 500 IP addresses.

#answer
subnet mask=21+2=23
host bits=32-23=9
we need 9 bits for host in each subnet
valid host=2^9=512 ips
current subnet mask=21
                   =21+9=30
new subnet mask: 255.255.255.252/30
1st Subnet:

Network address: 128.100.112.0/23
Usable IP range: 128.100.112.1 to 128.100.113.254
Broadcast address: 128.100.113.255
Total usable IP addresses: 510 (enough for at least 500)

2nd Subnet:

Network address: 128.100.114.0/23
Usable IP range: 128.100.114.1 to 128.100.115.254
Broadcast address: 128.100.115.255
Total usable IP addresses: 510 (enough for at least 500)

3rd subnet
Network address: 128.100.116.0/23
Usable IP range: 128.100.116.1 to 128.100.117.254
Broadcast address: 128.100.117.255
Total usable IP addresses: 510 (enough for at least 500)

4th subnet
Network address: 128.100.118.0/23
Usable IP range: 128.100.118.1 to 128.100.119.254
Broadcast address: 128.100.119.255
Total usable IP addresses: 510 (enough for at least 500)
