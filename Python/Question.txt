create a Python script that automatically fetches AWS RSS feeds every 15 minutes and stores them in a JSON file. The goal is to keep track of the latest updates from AWS without duplicating any feed entries.

Requirements:

Fetching Feeds: Your script should use the AWS RSS feed URL to retrieve the latest updates from AWS services.

Time Interval: The script should run at intervals of 15 minutes, ensuring that the information is up to date without causing excessive requests.

JSON Storage: Each fetched feed entry should be stored in JSON format within a file. This file will serve as a record of the AWS updates.

Preventing Duplicates: Before adding a feed entry to the JSON file, your script should check if it's already present. Duplicate entries should be avoided.

Hints:

Utilize Python's requests library to fetch the RSS feed.
For scheduling the script to run at regular intervals, consider using the time module or a library like schedule.
You can maintain a list of fetched feed entries in memory to compare with existing entries in the JSON file and avoid duplicates.
Remember to handle potential errors gracefully, such as network issues or invalid JSON data.
Submission:

Share your Python script along with any necessary files. Include comments to explain your code's logic and functionality. Additionally, provide a brief explanation of how your script ensures that feed entries are not duplicated.
