    Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
    Error response from daemon: No command specified
    
  #Reason
  
  The Alpine image is minimalist and requires a command to be specified explicitly, As a result, it throws an error saying "No command specified".
  
  # Second command
  
   $ docker create -v /tmp --name data ubuntu:14.04
   
   #Reason
   
   Ubuntu image includes a default shell command, allowing the container creation process to proceed successfully without specifying a command.

  #Summarize
  
   The first command is giving error and second command is successfully creating a container due to the difference of Docker images.
