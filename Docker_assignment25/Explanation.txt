  #  To determine which containers ran in the last 20 minutes
 
  sudo docker ps -a --filter 'exited=0' --format '{{.ID}} {{.CreatedAt}}' | awk '{print $1 " " $2}' | grep -E "$(date -d '20 minutes ago' '+%b %d %H:%M')"

  #  To determine which containers ran in the  minutes
  
  sudo docker ps -a --filter 'exited=0' | awk '{print $1 " "   $8 " " $9 " " $10 " " $11 " " $12 }' | grep -E "([1-9]\d|\d{3,})* minutes"
